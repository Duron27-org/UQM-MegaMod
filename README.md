# The Ur-Quan Masters HD MegaMod
A fork of The Ur-Quan Masters + HD that remasters the graphics with a veritable smorgasbord of extra features and options.

## Changes from the original

A full list of changes and features for the current release can be found on the [Main site](https://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Features).

And the full WIP changelog can be found in the root of this repository: [Changelog](https://github.com/JHGuitarFreak/UQM-MegaMod/blob/master/MegaMod%20Changelog.txt)

## Motivation

This project exists out of my love for Star Control II and The Ur-Quan Masters project. Fiddling with the code and assets as a hobby to try and expand my skill as a programmer .

## Windows Installation

Open up the installer, pick your optional content, wait for all of it to download and install, then play!

## MacOS X Installation

Mount the .dmg file and copy the app to your Applications folder.

## Building Yourself

### Windows

#### Visual Studio 
I've made the process super easy for Windows, as long as you have Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studios 2015-2019. Just load up the solution file and compile away.
For Visual Studio 2008 the solution file is under `build/msvs2008` for Visual Studios 2015-2019 the solution file is under `build/msvs2019`

#### MSYS2

Make sure you've installed all the necessary packes by executing these two commands in the MSYS2 bash:

	pacman -Syuu

then

	pacman -S make pkg-config mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-libogg \
		mingw-w64-i686-libpng mingw-w64-i686-libsystre \
		mingw-w64-i686-libvorbis mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-zlib

Start a MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit bash, `cd` to the UQM-MegaMod directory, then execute this command: 

	./build.sh uqm 

When executing this command for the first time you'll come to a configuration screen where you can select a few developer-centric options.
Just hit enter and UQM will start building. It'll take awhile and you'll see a few scary warnings but everything should build fine.

Missing .dll can be found in the MSYS2 installation folder under `mingw32\bin\`

### Other Platforms
You'll have to gather all of the necessary dependencies and hope for the best.

#### Tips

For all platforms when building from commandline you can use the command `-j#` to invoke multi-threaded performance to dramaticly speed up build time.  
Where `#` denotes how many threads you want the process to be locked to and plain `-j` uses all threads
Example: If you're running on a Ryzen 7 2700x you can use the command like so `./build.sh uqm -j8` to take advantage of eight threads or `./build.sh uqm -j` to take advantage of all 16 threads

## Fixes

### Windows

#### Image Cut-off in fullscreen

The most common contributor to this is the Windows built in DPI settings that scales UI for larger resolutions.
You can fix this one of two ways, by setting the UI scaling in Windows to 100% or overriding the scaling on UQM itself.

For overriding on UQM itself:  
Right click on the EXE -> click `Properties` -> click over to the `Compatibility` tab -> click `Change high DPI settings` -> click `Override high DPI scaling behavior` -> set `Scaling performed by:` to `Application`  
It should look like this:

## Controllers

When using a DualShock 4 controller *DO NOT* use DS4Windows. UQM and hence, MegaMod, support the DS4 without extra software.
The new controller layout option only works if you *don't* use DS4Windows.

Have a lovely day!

## Mod Compatibility
MegaMod is not compatible with any other mods nor are they compatible with MegaMod.
MegaMod is completely independant from Core UQM, HD-Mod, HD-Remix, Crazy Mod, Balance Mod, Extended, or any other mods.
As such MegaMod has its own packages and add-ons.

For example the HD-Mod add-on package `hires4x.zip` is not compatible with MegaMod as MegaMod has its own HD package currently named `mm-0.8.2-hd.uqm`.

And as MegaMod is not compatible with any other mods, do not install it over any existing UQM installations.

All MegaMod compatible add-ons and content can be found on the main website's Releases page: https://uqm-mods.sourceforge.net/Download
