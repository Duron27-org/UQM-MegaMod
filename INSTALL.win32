BUILDING THE WIN32 INSTALLER
----------------------------

You will need additional packages installed beyond what is necessary
for a build:

    pacman -S dos2unix mingw-w64-i686-nsis mingw-w64-i686-ntldd
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL mingw-w64-i686-SDL_gfx unzip zip

You will also need the INetC and MD5dll plugins for NSIS:

    https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/images/c/c9/Inetc.zip
    https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/images/d/d7/Md5dll.zip

Unzip these somewhere and then copy the 32-bit ANSI versions of the library
into place:

    cp Plugins/x86-ansi/INetC.dll /mingw32/share/nsis/Plugins/ansi/
    cp md5dll/ANSI/md5dll.dll /mingw32/share/nsis/Plugins/ansi/

These most likely are also (or rather) needed in the unicode path:

    cp Plugins/x86-ansi/INetC.dll /mingw32/share/nsis/Plugins/unicode/
    cp md5dll/ANSI/md5dll.dll /mingw32/share/nsis/Plugins/unicode/

If this is a new release of UQM, and content packs have not already been
regenerated, consult INSTALL.pkgs for the steps to update it. These steps
include updates to the "packages.nsh" file and the "uqm-installer.nsi" files,
so you should inspect these files to make sure that it's announcing the
correct version and downloading the correct versions of the content packs.

With these things in place, run the installer creator out of its directory:

    cd sc2/build/win32_install
    ./build-win32-installer.sh

If all goes well, this will build UQM and the KeyJam application, and then
build an NSIS-based installer that will install them and all necessary
ancillary files.
